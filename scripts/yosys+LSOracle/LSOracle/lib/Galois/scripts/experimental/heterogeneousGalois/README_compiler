  USAGE: ./compiler.sh <input-source-file>

If you do not want to generate heterogeneous CUDA code (which requires GGC):
  USAGE: ABELIAN_NON_HETEROGENEOUS=1 ./compiler.sh <input-source-file>
Note: Please DO NOT commit this generated code (could lead to a mismatch between CPU and GPU code).

There are 3 other environment variables that the compiler uses (which you can change):
* ABELIAN_LLVM_BUILD: build directory of LLVM containing ABELIAN plugins
* ABELIAN_GALOIS_ROOT: source directory of Galois containing ABELIAN headers and runtime
* ABELIAN_GGC_ROOT: source directory of GGC which compiles IrGL to CUDA

How to run:

Set the following environment variables:

BMK_DIST_PATH to the dist_apps
BMK_DISTLOGS to wherever you want the logs to go
BMK_MPIRUN_PATH to the mpirun binary

Then run the following in THIS directory (same as README):

python <path to bmk2/test2.py> run

TODO explain the bmktest2.py file

Kitty
=====

Kitty is a C++14 library that provides basic structure for truth table generation and manipulation. 
In the context of this project, kitty is extended to extract the logic attributes of different partitions. The attributes are represented to black and white figures, which are taken as input by the Neural Network to delegate the appropriate optimizer for a given partition. 
For a detailed explanation about the library, please access the `Kitty Documentation <https://libkitty.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_.

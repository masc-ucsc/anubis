Mockturtle
==========

Mockturtle is a C++17 library that implements different kinds of Boolean networks, as well as algorithms for logic manipulation. 
So far, LSOracle uses AIGs and MIGs to optimize different partitions of a circuit, taking advantage of the best features of each optimizer.

The MIGs capabilites were extended on this library, so that Mockturtle can also deal with sequential MIGs. In order to unlock sequential MIG logic optimization, the depth and area-oriented MIGs optimization algorithms were adapted. 

Mockturtle complete documentation is available `on this link <https://mockturtle.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.
